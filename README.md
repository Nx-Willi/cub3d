# ðŸ–± 42Paris Project | cub3d

## Objectives

The goal of this project is to make our first steps in the **Raycasting**.  
To help us, we will use the **[minilibx](https://harm-smits.github.io/42docs/libs/minilibx.html "42")** from 42, it asks to make a game in the steps of **[Wolfenstein 3D](http://users.atw.hu/wolf3d/)**.  
We have to manage the **textures** of the walls depending of their **directions**,  
set a **floor** and **ceiling colors** to two differents ones,  
move the camera with **W, A, S, D** (for moving) **LEFT_ARROW** and **RIGHT_ARROW** (for camera angle).  
The game will be **configured** by a **config file**, it define the **map**, the **color** of **floor** and **ceiling**, the **texture** files and the **start position** of the player.  
The mandatory part doesn't support wall collisions but the **bonus** part yes, we managed the **collision** and a **mini-map**.
